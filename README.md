gen-make
========

A simple makefile generator that can generate makefiles for
 * GNU-make targeting MinGW, clang-cl or MSVC.
 * Microsoft's Nmake targeting MSVC only.
 * OpenWatcom targeting only OpenWatcom programs for Windows.

A generated makefile in this git checkout directory is able to compile and
link a program `foo.exe`.
